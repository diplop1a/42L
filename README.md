# 42L
POSSIBLY the largest zip bomb created (10 undecillion zettabytes)

Over 42 layers (Hence 42L(ayers)) based on the Zip of Death (AKA 42.zip)
I guess you could also call it 42L(arge).

The only problem is that there are only a few programs that support 7z extraction, so it doesn't have many usecases, if any at all. I only made this because I thought the idea of sending a decillion zettabyte zip bomb into someone's Neuralink chip would be funny.

Please note that I am not responsible for what you do with this.

It's also completely untested, so it may not work at all to begin with, but WHATEVA!!
